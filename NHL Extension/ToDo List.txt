To-Do List:
-Set the refresh timers up correctly. In game updater vs. team updater
-Deal with extra overtimes in playoff games
-Better implementation for bug reporting
-Add SH or PP to badge text for short-handed or power play
-Clean up code!
  -Use api to get/build api links. They have it set up for most of the games. This will just be for the in game stats link
  -Add more functions for more readability
  -Make the game states an enum and make the if-else statements a switch
