To-Do List:
-High Pri:
	-Finish implementation of standings section in JS
	-Decide how to deal with not enough players on ice.
	-Cache data returned from API calls to avoid max API calls.

-Low Pri:
	-Make the UI reflect the selected team's color.
	-Make toggle switches more clear of which one is selected.
	-Better implementation for bug reporting
	-Add SH or PP to badge text for short-handed or power play and something for UI.
	-Loading spinner?
	-Center numbers in column and make the player name line up with the others in the column? (Follow how nhl.com does it.)
	-Make forwards correspond to their actual, current position on the ice?
